                <p>I follow the entrepreneur <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/jason-cohen/">Jason Cohen</a> on Bluesky and having enjoyed one of his articles he asked if I would like to comment on a chapter of his new book (no link yet!) on the same topic of A/B testing.</p>
                <p>I was happy to take a look (though couldn't contribute much as it was already very polished). I did note that there wasn't a simple site to calculate the figures he used in the book and thought I could easily add a calculator page to that effect. </p>
                <p>Please enjoy the book when it comes out and I hope the <a href="a_b_sample_size.html">calculator</a> is useful.</p>

                <p>Lounging by the pool on holiday, trying to avoid the sun's harshest glare (I like the heat but not the direct sun!), I started browsing.</p>
                <p>I knew it was UV that gives you burns - that's written on the back of the sun lotion - and now my smart watch told me the UV Index, but how did that relate to burn times?</p>
                <p>I found this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36850-x">paper</a> and as the authors suggested I thought the results would make for a useful web <a href="sunburn_time_calculator.html">app.</a></p>

                <p>The internet is excellent for recipes (maybe too good, it can be hard to find a definitive receipe!) however sometimes I've been delayed by a recipe measuring ingredients by US cup size.</p>
                <p>It's rare in the UK, and I understand in Europe in general, to list items by volume, more often weight is used (volume is still used for liquids).</p>
                <p>The conversion between volume and weight is complicated by different ingredients having different densities. This <a href="cup_conversion.html">calculator</a> uses a stored set of densities for different ingredients but allows for manual entry of a density value if your ingredient is not present.</p>
                <p>If there's an ingredient I've missed you think should be there as standard please let me know! Otherwise happy cooking!</p>

                <p>So a bit of tweaking to the CSS to remove the sidebars and a tidy up has hopefully made things much easier to use on the small screen.</p>

                <p>I needed a quick QR code for another project and went online to get one. The first five or so sites offered very fancy code generators with lots of options but when it came to generate suddenly you had to enter your email.</p>
                <p>Eventually I decided it was easier to download some QR generation code and DIY.</p>
                <p>Hence the idea for this calculator - a basic but functional QR code generator that doesn't require you to join a mailing list.</p>

                <p>Enjoying a nice Aperol spritz (3 parts Prosecco, 2 parts Aperol, 1 part soda) on a sunny evening I was trying to work out how much alcohol was in it.</p>
                <p>Drinks with only one alcohol type of a fixed percentage are easier to work out (and we have a <a href='alcohol_units_calculator.html'>calculator</a> for that!) but with multiple ingrediants of different volumens and strengths it gets harder.</p>
                <p>Hence this calculator - where you can add multiple ingrediants and it'll sum up the total amount of alcohol and units it contains.</p>
                <p>Very handy when you love a Negroni (1 part gin, 1 part vermouth, 1 part Campari)!</p>

                <p>A new calculator to work out how much water is needed to cook dry rice in.</p>
                <p>Moving to cooking rice in a microwave with the proper amount of water has been a game changer in my household, its quicker, there's no guesswork and the results are fantastic!</p>
                <p>However I kept having to look up the ratio of water to rice to use so built this calculator to work it out for me - and can work out how much water depending on how many I'm cooking for.</p>
                <p>During the research phase I did look up the ratios other people online were suggesting - and there were almost as many views as there were webpages. So whilst I get great results with a ratio of 2.5 I've made that changeable in case you have a preference. If you do let me know!</p>

                <p>We've some more calculators to come, mostly coming from situations where I've been reaching for a spreadsheet to work our some numbers.</p>
                <p>We also have a new contact address: info@easycalcguru.com should you have some ideas for other calculators?</p>

                <p>Added the alcohol units calculator. It can be tricky to work out how much you're drinking with different drink percentages and sizes of container. 
                    E.g. a small glass of wine has a higher percentage, but about half the alcohol of a strong pint of beer. When you're trying to count your UK units its useful to know this value.</p>
                <p>Its a straightforward multiplication calculation but dealing with fractions of percent is easier via the calculator. I've also added some quick buttons for common container sizes and percentages so make calculating (in the pub?) easier.</p>
                <p>This was also my first dealing with <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a> which is about showing formulas on web pages which wil be handy for this site!</p>

                <p>Calculators is live!</p>
                <p>This project was to put online some webpages that perform some useful everyday calculations (or maybe not everyday but frequently!).</p>
                <p>But also to include the formulas behind the calculations so that a user can understand what is going on and would be able to recreate the calculation elsewhere.
                    I was getting sick of every time I wanted to look up mortgage calculations there were websites to do that but it was not easy to find the formula behind the calculation. 
                    This site aims to change that.

                <p>Enjoying a nice Aperol spritz (3 parts Prosecco, 2 parts Aperol, 1 part soda) on a sunny evening I was trying to work out how much alcohol was in it.</p>
                <p>Drinks with only one alcohol type of a fixed percentage are easier to work out (and we have a <a href='alcohol_units_calculator.html'>calculator</a> for that!) but with multiple ingrediants of different volumens and strengths it gets harder.</p>
                <p>Hence this calculator - where you can add multiple ingrediants and it'll sum up the total amount of alcohol and units it contains.</p>
                <p>Very handy when you love a Negroni (1 part gin, 1 part vermouth, 1 part Campari)!</p>

                <p>A new calculator to work out how much water is needed to cook dry rice in.</p>
                <p>Moving to cooking rice in a microwave with the proper amount of water has been a game changer in my household, its quicker, there's no guesswork and the results are fantastic!</p>
                <p>However I kept having to look up the ratio of water to rice to use so built this calculator to work it out for me - and can work out how much water depending on how many I'm cooking for.</p>
                <p>During the research phase I did look up the ratios other people online were suggesting - and there were almost as many views as there were webpages. So whilst I get great results with a ratio of 2.5 I've made that changeable in case you have a preference. if you do let me know!</p>

                <p>It's rebrand time! web-calculators.pages.dev was a descriptive title but hardly tripped off the tongue. EasyCalcGuru.com captures the aim better - easy to use everyday calculations online but also giving you the explanation behind the process.</p>
                <p>We've some more calculators to come, mostly coming from situations where I've been reaching for a spreadsheet to work our some numbers.</p>
                <p>We also have a new contact address: info@easycalcguru.com should you have some ideas for other calculators?</p>

                <h2>Alcohol units</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">Date: February 6, 2024</p>

                <p>Added the alcohol units calculator. It can be tricky to work out how much you're drinking with different drink percentages and sizes of container. 
                    E.g. a small glass of wine has a higher percentage, but about half the alcohol of a strong pint of beer. When you're trying to count your UK units its useful to know this value.</p>
                <p>Its a straightforward multiplication calculation but dealing with fractions of percent is easier via the calculator. I've also added some quick buttons for common container sizes and percentages so make calculating (in the pub?) easier.</p>
                <p>This was also my first dealing with <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a> which is about showing formulas on web pages which wil be handy for this site!</p>

                <p>Calculators is live!</p>
                <p>This project was to put online some webpages that perform some useful everyday calculations (or maybe not everyday but frequently!).</p>
                <p>But also to include the formulas behind the calculations so that a user can understand what is going on and would be able to recreate the calculation elsewhere.
                    I was getting sick of every time I wanted to look up mortgage calculations there were websites to do that but it was not easy to find the formula behind the calculation. 
                    This site aims to change that.

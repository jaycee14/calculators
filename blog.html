            <p>Added the alcohol units calculator. It can be tricky to work out how much you're drinking with different drink percentages and sizes of container. 
                E.g. a small glass of wine has a higher percentage, but about half the alcohol of a strong pint of beer. When you're trying to count your UK units its useful to know this value.</p>
            <p>Its a straightforward multiplication calculation but dealing with fractions of percent is easier via the calculator. I've also added some quick buttons for common container sizes and percentages so make calculating (in the pub?) easier.</p>
            <p>This was also my first dealing with <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a> which is about showing formulas on web pages which wil be handy for this site!</p>

            <p>Calculators is live!</p>
            <p>This project was to put online some webpages that perform some useful everyday calculations (or maybe not everyday but frequently!).</p>
            <p>But also to include the formulas behind the calculations so that a user can understand what is going on and would be able to recreate the calculation elsewhere.
                I was getting sick of every time I wanted to look up mortgage calculations there were websites to do that but it was not easy to find the formula behind the calculation. 
                This site aims to change that.
